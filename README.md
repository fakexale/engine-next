# Compilation
Compilation on Visual Studio Code is easy, for other editors you'll need to enter commands manually, however.

This assumes you have the tooling required installed.

## VSCode
**Build Tasks**:
Access Build Tasks with ``Ctrl+Shift+B``

To get started, simply start with the ``setup`` task, followed by ``build``.

You will now have a ``build.rbxm`` model file in your project root. Have fun.

## Other Editors
**Bash Scripts**: Using Bash Shell scripts to automate setup is supported.

This will require you to use Windows Subsystem for Linux, or using Git Bash. 
Scripts are located in the ``scripts`` directory.

To get started, simply start with the ``setup.sh``, followed by ``build.sh``.

You will now have a ``build.rbxm`` model file in your project root. Have fun.
